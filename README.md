# posterplay

I used poster photos from the [National Poster Retrospecticus](http://nationalposterretrospecticus.com/) to simulate an OSX screen saver. This uses [packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) (to little effect), and [jquery.transit](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/).

This is a [cactus](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus) site. If you don't have cactus, you can install it with:

```
sudo easy_install cactus
```

## Run it.

With cactus installed, navigate to the project root and type `cactus serve`
